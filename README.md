### About

This app is designed as a teaching aid to assist in teaching about radioactive decay. A popular activity to get pupils thinking about the random nature of radioactive decay is to use dice - usually 100, and roll them. Rolls of a certain number would be deemed to have 'decayed'. Over time, the number of undecayed isotopes will decrease exponentially.
The exponential decay is usally not perfect for only 100 dice, and it is not practical to roll 1000 or 10000 dice, but this simularion can do this quickly. Additionally, more or less stable isotopes can be modeled using dice with a different number of sides.

The app was built using react.
